"""`robocorp.vault` is a library for interacting with secrets stored in the ``Robocorp Control Room Vault``.

Uses ``Robocorp Control Room Vault`` (by default) or file-based secrets, which can be taken
into use by setting some environment variables.

Robocorp Vault relies on environment variables, which are normally set
automatically by the Robocorp Work Agent or Assistant when a run is
initialized by the Robocorp Control Room. When developing robots locally
in VSCode, you can use the `Robocorp Code Extension`_ to set these
variables automatically as well.

Alternatively, you may set these environment variable manually using
`rcc`_ or directly in some other fashion. The specific variables which
must exist are:

- ``RC_API_SECRET_HOST``: URL to Robocorp Vault API
- ``RC_API_SECRET_TOKEN``: API Token for Robocorp Vault API
- ``RC_WORKSPACE_ID``: Control Room Workspace ID

.. _Robocorp Control Room Vault: https://robocorp.com/docs/development-guide/variables-and-secrets/vault
.. _Robocorp Code Extension: https://robocorp.com/docs/developer-tools/visual-studio-code/extension-features#connecting-to-control-room-vault
.. _rcc: https://robocorp.com/docs/rcc/workflow

File-based secrets can be set by defining two environment variables.

- ``RC_VAULT_SECRET_MANAGER``: FileSecrets
- ``RC_VAULT_SECRET_FILE``: Absolute path to the secrets database file

Example content of local secrets file:

```json
{
    "swaglabs": {
        "username": "standard_user",
        "password": "secret_sauce"
    }
}
```

OR

```yaml

swaglabs:
    username: standard_user
    password: secret_sauce
```

Example:

```python    
from robocorp import vault

def reading_secrets():
    secrets_container = vault.get_secret('swaglabs')
    print(f"My secrets: {secrets_container}")
    
def modifying_secrets():
    secret = vault.get_secret("swaglabs")
    secret["username"] = "nobody"
    vault.set_secret(secret)
```
